# Python-Numpy-Project

The Numpy-Python project focused on analyzing taxi data utilizes the Numpy library in Python for efficient numerical computations. The project involves extracting insights from a dataset containing information about taxi rides. Key analyses conducted on the dataset include:

Mean Speed of All Cab Rides:
Calculating the average speed of all cab rides to gauge the overall efficiency of the taxi service.

Number of Rides Taken in February:
Determining the total count of taxi rides taken specifically in the month of February to understand seasonal trends or variations in demand.

Number of Rides with Tip Greater Than $50:
Identifying the number of rides where passengers provided tips exceeding $50, indicating instances of exceptional service or generosity.

Number of Rides with Drop-offs at JFK Airport:
Counting the occurrences where taxi rides concluded with drop-offs at JFK Airport, offering insights into transportation patterns related to air travel.
